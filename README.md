# Landslide-Detection-using-Sentinel-2-Data
This repository provides a deep learning-based pipeline for landslide detection using Sentinel-2 multispectral data. It features models like U-Net, SegNet, and DeepLabV3+, with preprocessing steps (normalization, NDVI calculation), training, validation, and performance evaluation using metrics like precision, recall, and F1 score.
